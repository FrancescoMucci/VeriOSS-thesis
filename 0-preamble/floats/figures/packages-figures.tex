%-------------FIGURES-PACKAGES-LOADED-BY-CLASSICTHESIS---------

%\usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx} % WILL BE LOADED by "dia-classicthesis-ldpkg".
% The "graphicx" package builds upon the "graphics" package and can be seen as an extended version of it: it provides a key-value interface for optional arguments to the command "\includegraphics". This packages rely on features that are not in TeX itself; these features must be supplied by the "driver" used to print the "dvi" file, but not all drivers support the same features: you can specify in the options which driver is being used (in our case "pdftex"), but normally this is not necessary; it will be enstablished automatically allowing the document to be portable between different systems.
