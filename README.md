# VeriOSS master's thesis

This repository contains my thesis work for the [Master's degree in Computer Science](https://www.informaticamagistrale.unifi.it/) at the [University of Florence](https://www.unifi.it/).

The goal of this thesis is to design, develop and formally verify the Solidity smart contract responsible for the partial reward process of the bounty claim protocol, an instance of a two-party fair exchange protocol, of VeriOSS, a blockchain-based bug bounty platform.

This thesis is the natural continuation of the work I carried out under the [SysMA research unit](https://sysma.imtlucca.it/), during the academic year 2019-2020, as holder of the research project fellowship grant **VeriOSS smart contract development** (issued by [IMT School for Advanced Studies Lucca](https://www.imtlucca.it/en) and financed with the funds of the project PAI 2018 *VeriOSS: a security-by-smart contract verification framework for Open Source Software* - P0137).
